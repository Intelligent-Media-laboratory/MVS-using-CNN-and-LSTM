# MVS-using-CNN-and-LSTM
Cloud-Assisted Multi-View Video Summarization using CNN and Bi-Directional LSTM 
==================

Paper
=========
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8765236

#### The package contains the following three files.

### 1. FullDatasetFeatures.py
It contains the code to extract features from the overall dataset. 

### 2. LSTM.py
It contains code to train the extracted features using Bi-directional LSTM. Splitting the code into train, test and validation is already included in this code.

### 3. OneFileOnlineTest.py
This is to test one video file on the trained model and write its output video.

### Notice
We are really sorry to have the raw code, but to ensure the availability of an easy and understandable code we need some time.
Feel free to contact me at tanveerkhattak3797@gmail.com if you have any queries or you will be okay with raw format code.
Thanks
